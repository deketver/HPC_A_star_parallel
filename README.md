# Parallel A* Graph Search Project

University project about parallelization of A\* algorithm for distributed computing models
without shared memory via MPI (Message Passing Interface).

## Project structure overview
- *serial* - sequential version of A\* algorithm
- *PNBA_parallel* - Parallel New Bidirectional A\* search algorithm
- *literature* - pdf versions of resource articles
- *datasets* - subset of randomly generated datasets for A\* search algorithm

Draft of implementation of HDA\* algorithm is left unmerged in the respective branch.
